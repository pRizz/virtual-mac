## Key Decisions

|----------|------|-----------|
| Near-full replica fidelity | 2026-01-17 | User wants authentic macOS experience, browser limits accepted |
| All 5 apps in v1 | 2026-01-17 | User wants complete app layer polish |
| YOLO workflow mode | 2026-01-17 | User prefers faster iteration with fewer confirmations |
| Inline keyboard handler logic | 2026-01-17 | Simpler than closure cloning, avoids borrowing issues |
| US-style thousands separator | 2026-01-17 | Comma separator matches macOS Calculator US locale |
