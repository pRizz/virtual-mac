# Phase 7: Notes App 1:1 Parity - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Notes should feel indistinguishable from macOS Notes in both visuals and behavior. It should look like the real app at a glance, and once you start using it the interactions should reinforce that same native feel.

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Indistinguishable feel** — the overall experience should read as macOS Notes, not an approximation
- **Visual + behavioral parity** — the layout and the way it behaves should both match the real app

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements - open to standard parity approaches.

<notes>
## Additional Context

Sidebar/list flow and editor styling are equally important to get right.
