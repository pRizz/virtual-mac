**Archived:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v1.0.
For current requirements, see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (created for next milestone).

---

## Overview

Polish the five core applications (Calculator, Terminal, Notes, TextEdit, Finder) to closely replicate the look and behavior of their real macOS counterparts, within browser constraints.

## Scope

### v1 (This Milestone)

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| REQ-001 | Calculator app matches macOS Calculator visually and functionally | High | ✅ Complete |
| REQ-002 | Terminal app matches macOS Terminal visually with realistic shell simulation | High | ✅ Complete |
| REQ-003 | Notes app matches macOS Notes with folders, formatting, and search | High | ✅ Complete |
| REQ-004 | TextEdit app matches macOS TextEdit with toolbar and document feel | High | ✅ Complete |
| REQ-005 | Finder app matches macOS Finder with polished sidebar, views, and toolbar | High | ✅ Complete |

### v2 (Future)

- Safari, Messages, Mail, Photos, Music, Calendar apps
- Multi-window support for same app type
- Drag-and-drop between apps
- Clipboard integration between apps

### Out of Scope

- Real file system access (browser security prevents this)
- Actual process execution in Terminal (simulated commands only)
- iCloud sync for Notes (no backend)
- System-level keyboard shortcuts that browsers intercept
- Native app launching mechanisms
